    <h2>Visit one of the Netherlands’ most cherished attractions!</h2>
    <p>The current building of the Rijksmuseum, designed by Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers, first opened its doors in 1885 and has been a national heritage site since 1970. The recent renovation project has followed in the footsteps of similar initiatives by world museums such as the Tate Modern in London and the Louvre in Paris, in terms of combining the old with the modern. The atrium features a high glass ceiling and spacious, contemporary architecture which blends uniquely with the traditional red-brick walls. The collection contains more than one million pieces and has about eight thousand paintings, sculptures and historical artifacts on display, spanning from the year 1200 to the present. Some of the most notable works include Rembrandt’s The Night Watch (1642), Vermeer’s The Milkmaid (1647) and one of Van Gogh’s untitled self-portraits (1887).</p>
